Reproducability package

To run, call the Python3 file main.py and pass through the command line arguments: a text file with your access token, the owner of a repository, and the repository name. Example: python3 main.py token.txt flutter flutter.

This will output several files. No special naming convention is provided to differentiate between different repositories, so take care to move all of these files to their own folder between each run. You can find these files from our research in the folder named results. Some statistics will be output on the terminal for some of our previous revisions of our research questions. These can be ignored.

To analyze research question 1, place each file named contributor_start_date.csv into the data folder in the folder named RQ1. It is wise to name each of these files to what the repo name was as these names will be used in the analysis. Run the shell script called analyze.sh.

To analyze research question 2, you can find an excel spreadsheet in the folder named RQ2.
